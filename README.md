# UJISeaBattle
This project is an app for playing Battleship against an AI opponent with two different levels of difficulty. It has been developed using Android Studio with Kotlin as a programming language. It was a class assignment that required that the app worked specifically as it does. As a project, it was useful to learn how to program directly for Android without using a game engine as a middleman, given an specific set of requirements. You can download the APK file on the releases section of this repository and play the game in any android device with Android 8.0+.
